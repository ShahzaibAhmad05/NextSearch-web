## To set up the Frontend locally
 
- Make sure your terminal is in the frontend directory, for example, it should look like this (on windows):

````
PS C:/Users/<username>/Projects/NextSearch/frontend
````

- Create a file in the frontend directory named ".env.example" and paste this into it:

````
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080
````

- Now run:

````
npm install
````

and that's it! Frontend is now set up and ready for testing.
